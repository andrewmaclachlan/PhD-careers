# Outline 

Focus on industry roles as no one ever really tells you how to apply - or no one told me.

This has come from the RGS session last week, where I felt no one actually said how to do this, even though we were all asked to reflect on our careers post PhD.

It was sort of scary how many people defaulted to the classic academic introduction even though we'd been asked to say how we'd ended up in our roles. 

--

**It's as if no one really wants to talk about how difficult it is.**  

A second session will look at academic roles and applications 

Two parts of this session:

  * Tips from interviews 
  
  * Dealing with competency questions
  
---

# Roles I got an interview for post PhD 

*	GLA (1 interview, 1 role) + assessment

*	C40 Cities (3 interviews, 1 role) + assessment

*	DEFRA (2 interviews, 2 roles) â€“ one had 50 vacancies! + assessment(s)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

*	UCL (2 interviews, 2 roles) - 1 non academic + assessment before the interview, presented at the interview

*	Telespazio (1 role, 1 interview)

* Airbus / some subsidiary company (1 role, 1 interview)

*	CRUK (2 interviews, 2 roles) + assessment



.footnote[
[1] Just to get to this stage i'd applied for around 6 positions with competency questions and video tasks]

# Pre-interview

You need to do your homework on the company and people interviewing you (if told)

Actions

* Do they cover travel expenses - are you based outside London?
  * Usually in the UK they don't
  
* Can you email the hiring manager to get more specific details on the role?
  * From my experience it's usually HR

* Do they publish anything from their group or department you can talk about?

* Can you find them on LinkedIn? 
--


Research

* What are their current areas of work

* What are the challenges they face 

* What could you contribute + where do you see future opportunities 

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# Qualify your panel / assessor 

## Do they know what a PhD is and what it invovles

---

# Assumptions

In our industry everyone knows what a PhD is 

It's essential to be aware of different career paths who might not.

Those interviewing you:

--

- Might not have attended University 

--

- Might have secured their role after their undergraduate and been promoted within 

--

- Might not equate your "PhD student" experience to "actual" experience

--

- Might not have had postgraduate teaching assistants depending on their degree

--

- Might not really care if you have published, or really know what's involved. 

--

As an undergraduate or high school student did you know the publishing process or did you know what a PhD was?

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# An interviewer: 

&gt; I didn't realise a PhD invovled all that, i assumed it was just an extension of an undergraduate degree.


&gt; I had no idea that you could teach students during a PhD.

# Researcher 

&lt;img src="img/researcher.png" width="400pt" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---

# Why compaines hire - see Geolytix talk

Two main reasons:
--

* Replace someone - very specific skills 


--

* Expanding - looking for good people

--

In industry it's unlikely you will be able to email the hiring manager, you can try but HR will often reply. 

But in the interview you can ask why are you recruiting **first**, before they start asking you questions.

If they are replacing someone then tailor your answers to the job description.

If they are expanding then showcase the breadth of your work more.

**It's hard when you don't know**

---
# Interviewers

Two types of interviews

--

* Those who want a quick fix to do a set task / role

  - i was told i'd be expected to write Python code all day for image processing
  - there would be limited opportunity to propose projects
  - most of the lab held PhDs
  - wanted the job to be done, nothing else

--

* Those who can see and want to nurture talent
  
  - outline development opportunities
  - open to you proposing different ideas
  - will grant you time to pursue other interesting things

**Usually** you are looking for the second

The first will **often** be boring. 

---
# Assessments

My general thought process on this

&gt; I've not spent 4 years doing a PhD to be assessed on a 30 minute task

--


But I was. It was awful. When is anyone ever assessed like that in real life.

--
## Tasks included

* I was presented with 10 sources on pension reform and had to evaluate them + produce recommendations for policy change or further investigation in the interview

--

* I was given an Excel spreadsheet and some information and had to compute the potential for using solar panels in informal settlements

--

* I was asked to design an engagement strategy for a local sustainable initiative  

--

* An SQL test 

---
# Assessments 2

Know your audience and what they want...

--

* In the 10 sources on pension form - they wanted a answer. 

* I picked holes in all of the studies before providing one.

--

* I badly failed the SQL test, but I did say I could do this all in R.

---

# It's **YOUR** project 

Academics avoid talking about themselves / their work in the first person...usually. "The project"

* A PhD is **your** project, at an interview they want to know what you did, **specifically you**

--

* In a PhD you do everything, you are:

  * the project manager
  * the researcher
  * the trainer 
  * the PR person
  * the collaborator contact 
  * the finance person (sort of, managing research funds etc)
  * the content creator 
  * the analyst
  * the programmer
  * the brand manager (of your project)
  * the policy officer (producing recommendations)
  * the product owner / maintainer (your academic work / code)
  * the novelist!
  
  + whatever else you do

&lt;img src="img/superman.jpeg" width="400pt" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

# Another major difference
--

## You have full responsbility for the project

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# This often doesn't fit easily into job roles as **they usually focus on one or two of these**
--

## Combined with how academics are trained to talk and write

--

## = No job

---
# Break it down

It's very unlikely that a **single** employee has worked on a large project for the same time as your PhD (3-4 years). 

--

Most companies work in teams on nearly all projects in some form. Teams that code together and write together. 

--

Introduction 

* Start by stating that - setting expectations + most examples are from my doctoral research that **I have been solely responsible** for, over the last four years.

* Talk about how you **developed** the project and specific **milestones** 

* How you set goals / targets, monitored and achieved them **with proof**

* How you led people with competing interests for to solve mutual common problems 

* How you overcame challenges - methodological, but usually **people related are better examples**. 

* Often companies can find someone to fix a technical issue, but they can't *easily* fix people issues.

---
# Break it down

Remember that **most of the time** they don't really care about the specifics of your work. More, the area you have worked in and the transferable skills you have.

--

They are **probably** scoring you as you talk on set criteria. 

--

Questions (to you)

* Refer to your PhD but to specific roles you were doing not just 'the PhD'
--


* As an (international) project manager I set the direction of the project with collaborative support from more senior members of staff and stakeholders

--


* As the only programmer on the task I dealt with complex, large and messy datasets on a regular basis...my process for handling data is...

--


* As the data visulization expert on the project...

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# Talk about your specific research too much....

&lt;img src="img/phd_carer.jfif" width="600pt" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
# Questions about project planning 

It's not always directly obvious how you plan your PhD - often it's organic but industry like a formal process. 

* Waterfall - like manufacturing, linear 

* Agile - incremental and iterative. 

--

* SMEAC

Situation, Mission, Execution, Administration, Communication   

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# Dealing with competency questions

---
# What are competencies

Qualities that an employer wants to have in their team / organisation 

Levels the playing field a bit in terms of qualifications - to an extent, as long as you can show the competency the example doesn't really matter. 

--

Examples:

* Decision making

* Leadership

* Conflict resolution 

* Team building 

* Problem solving

--

These are then categorised at different levels or grades depending on the role

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# Within your PhD you will have shown all these skills but they aren't always directly obvious

## like perhaps in an industry workplace envrionment 

---
# Example 1 - grade 7 role statement

Personal statement that included reflection of specifc criteria:

&lt;br&gt;


* Your personal statement should include how **you meet the Technical requirements of your area of expertise (membership and relevant degree criteria)**. 

&lt;br&gt;


* Please also include in your CV and personal statement, **evidence against the Behavioural and Experience criteria** within the candidate pack. 

&lt;br&gt;

* It would be helpful if you could **indicate your analytical specialism and also any of the listed posts** in which you have a particular interest

---
# Example 1 - grade 7 role statement

This got me an interview after two online assessments 

Look at the language i've used and the titles i've called my positions. It's written so the person reading it doesn't need to know what a PhD is. 

e.g. 

&gt; I have just completed a term serving as an **international, multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary project manager between a top UK and Australian university with association to Australian state and local government departments**. As the funding for this **project is concluding, and having successfully delivered all project outcomes on time and within budget** I am **seeking** an applied and policy oriented research role with a social and/or environmental focus

I then state why i'm interested 

&gt; Being the government department for environmental protection I was drawn to explore relevant challenging and exciting vacancies within DEFRA that could benefit from my skill set whilst providing personal professional development opportunities to enhance my applied research ability.

---
# Example 1 - grade 7 role statement

Next up is technical qualifications that i meet - clearly stated 

&gt; I **am able to meet all technical requirements with a first class honours degree in human geography, a masterâ€™s degree with distinction in applied geographic information systems and remote sensing alongside a doctorate degree in geography**, specifically applied sustainable city development.

Then i move to what **I** have done:

&gt; In this role **I acted decisively** in guiding my work through unbiased and data informed decisions making sense of international, national and local pressures in adhering to strategic development goals. **I fostered international and multi-disciplinary project links**, managed a scientific team and engaged stakeholders with differing agendas to form consensus based solutions with enthusiasm and passion. **I took personal responsibility for driving my work forward, clearly outlined roles and responsibilities through translating project priorities into outcome focused objectives** alongside consistent evaluation, **with adjustments** where necessary.

# Example 1 - grade 7 role statement

This application wanted you to talk about the varying needs of partners. I had a sentance almost replicating the requirement....

&gt; I understood the **varying needs of all partners and adapted materials and outputs where necessary, building strong interpersonal relationships inducing an inclusive working environment, sharing knowledge and resources**. The project was successfully delivered **on time and within budget and I received national recognition**. These successes provide external validation of my applied, multi-institutional and innovative research abilities.

# Example 1 - grade 7 role statement

I explicitly state how my skills are transferable 

&gt; Whilst aforementioned positions and experiences are specific to geographical discipline **my transferable skills include**: innovative research development, statistical analysis, (big) data processing and management, team management and team work alongside successful grant bidding, concise written communication, effective image design, teaching and public speaking. 

I end with excitement about the role + where my papers can be found. 

&gt; The challenges posed from the advertised evidence specialists and analysts aim to **provide exciting insights to shape, monitor and evaluate policies**. With my applied research background I would **supply valuable contributions in assuring applied, effective and data-informed recommendations** and evaluations.

Usually they ask you not to include any personal or identifiable information.

# Example 2 - grade 2 role statement

These questions often have a specified word limit - it's a skill to meet all the requirements. 

## Problem solving

* Processes and distils a variety of information to understand a problem fully

&gt; Most notably during my latest position (international project manager) this entailed overcoming **daily theoretical, methodological and logistical issues that were restricting current approaches** in order to provide data-driven solutions to policy issues whilst building upon existing frameworks. For example...

# Example 2 - grade 2 role statement

## Problem solving

* Seeks the opinions and experiences of others to understand different approaches to problem solving

&gt; as an academic instructor that involved lecturing, tutoring, creation of material and mentoring I often faced multiple logistical and student problems. Postgraduate students were regularly taught about cutting edge methodological processes from academics within the department associated with high intensity learning. Consequently they would often have numerous technical queries during laboratory sessions. **Addressing these issues meant firstly obtaining a comprehensive understanding myself, seeking clarification from other staff members if necessary and breaking the practical down into logical steps for students to follow. Student feedback indicated effective problem solving with consistent positive ratings (e.g. 4.7/5)**. During this employment I also successfully attained professional association to the higher education academy through academic work, peer and supervisor reviews.

# Example 2 - grade 2 role statement

## Planning and organising 

* Challenges the views of others in an open and constructive way

* Persuades others, using evidence based knowledge, modifying approach to deliver message effectively

&gt; Similarly, within my own projects I have **challenged the way planning departments make decisions in relation to temperature mitigation**, this is particularly important as heat related risk has now risen to the third highest cause of global disaster morality, currently excluded from future loss estimates under future predicted GreenHouse Gas (GHGs) scenarios. **Consequently my published work provides a logical approach in resolving current inadequacies in planning procedures and negating millions of dollars currently spent on reactive temperature mitigation strategies** that could be mis-guiding remediative greening actions. This research was also selected for oral presentations at multiple international conferences (e.g. European Geosciences Union) receiving overall positive feedback.

# Example 2 - grade 2 role statement

## Organisational Awareness

* Recognises how political changes and sensitivities impact on own and teamâ€™s work

&gt; Factors included ensuring documentation was culturally sensitive, avoiding the use of Western acronyms and consulting with partner intuitions to address any concerns they might have, often being straightforward logistical solutions. All employment that I have been involved with has passed ethical approval where necessary. Political sensitives from my work would surround the potential criticism of planning departments in their lagged uptake in using data-driven approaches to inform decisions. **To avoid negative interpretations such as this my work has always been presented as building upon current approaches** taking into account the limitations of partners (e.g. spatial data expertise and software) and including them throughout the process ensured a sustained collaborative partnerships and appropriateness of the research.

# Example 2 - grade 2 role statement

## Organisational Awareness

* Is aware of the changing needs of Londoners, anticipating resulting changes for work agendas

&gt; the documents: Londonâ€™s response to climate, the spatial development strategy for London and Londonâ€™s Mental Health have been extensively cited throughout my published work, amongst similar documentation from other global cities.


&gt; my analytical expertise can also be applied to other environmental challenges currently facing London including: air quality, energy use, waste, flood risk, water scarcity and water quality. **All these factors have a spatial dimensions and can be analysed using similar methodological approaches to ensure policy compliance, effective uptake and the future sustainability of London aligning with global initiatives including the City Resilience Framework, United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the United Nations New Urban Agenda.**

# Questions you should ask

* What does the role usually involve on a day to day basis 

* How many projects will I usually be working on at the same time

* What is the progression structure of the organisation 

* Will i be able to contribute to [insert specific project you have looked up]

* Will there be opportunities to explore my own ideas 

* What has been your [the interviewer's] favourite project that you have worked on

* **CAN I HAVE FEEDBACK FROM THIS ASSESSMENT AND INTERVIEW** regardless of outcome

---
# Take aways

* I only mentioned PhD once 

--

* I described what **I** did not what **we** did on the project - as a PhD student you basically do everything.

--

* In fact should your supervisor even be on the papers you write as an author - most journals specify comments aren't enough 

--

* Every point I make has a supported example - **with some kind of evidence metric** - proving I can do it.

--

* I explained the process of peer review and stated what I was responsible for

&gt; The demands of peer review are often difficult to navigate with scientific experts commenting, asking for more analysis and trying to pull apart methodological reasoning. I tackled this through a systematic and logical approach, providing additional explanation where necessary but ensuring article integrity. I was solely responsible for the final versions of all published articles and figures, **with figure selection for journal issue front covers highlighting my scientific communication ability.**   
---

# Take aways 2

* I mentioned everything was delivered:

  * Successfully (with examples of success)
  * On time
  * Within budget (value of PhD funding)

--
  
* I list the partners I interacted with + how what I was doing tried to improve their outcomes

--

* The work was outcome focused

--

* I outline transferable skills 

--

* In some cases I reword what the competency is in my response

# Remember this is advice and not science. I got through:

  ### the competency questions / personal statements
  ### the online 'working with people' video scenario tests
  ### the technical online tests (for certain roles)
  
### But...I never got an offer from a job interview

# Conclusion

* How to 'qualify' interviewers

* 

* Tools for dealing with industry interviews

* Academia is a bubble that others outside don't know about 

* How to successfully demonstrate your experience to those not in academia 

* Re-phrase your skills based on the intended audience + purpose

* How to effectively respond to competency based questions

* **Hopefully not waste six months post-PhD working all this out**
